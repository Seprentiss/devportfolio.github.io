                        Hi there! I'm an aspiring data scientist who enjoys discovering patterns and using data to tell stories. 
			I've lived all over the country and have had the opportunity to meet and engage with many great people from all walks of life. 
			My life experiences have made me versatile and equipped me with the capacity to communicate and share insights with people from all backgrounds. 
			I have strong technical skills and an academic background in computer science, statistics, and databases.

	    <h3>Data Analyst Consultant</h3>
	    <br><br>
	    <p>
	    As a Data Analyst Consultant, I employed Python and Excel to analyze and aggregate data for a minor political party, aiming to secure an electoral vote. 
	    By identifying key metrics aligned with party goals and utilizing R for visualizations, I effectively communicated insights to stakeholders. 
	    Through evidence-based recommendations, I informed strategic decision-making, ultimately optimizing the party's campaign strategy.
	    <br><br>
	    During my sophomore year at Purdue University, I undertook a freelance project collaborating with a fellow student to support a high school football team in surpassing a challenging division rival. 
	    Using Python and Monte Carlo simulations, we devised game scenarios and implemented strategies that resulted in a remarkable 7% increase in expected win performance and a significant 13.4% improvement in expected one-possession game performance. 
	    We also created real-time visualizations in Tableau that allowed coaches to make fast data-driven decisions on the field during games. 
	    Our data-driven approach greatly enhanced the team's overall game strategy and positioned them for greater success against their formidable opponents.
	    <br><br>
	    These projects underscore my ability to independently seek and execute data analysis projects, delivering impactful results through collaboration, data-driven insights, and compelling presentations.

                 As a Teaching Assistant (TA), I had the privilege of teaching computer science freshmen as part of a summer program, providing them with a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java and Python, along with practical knowledge of GitHub and Unix environments. 
		 In addition to this, I designed the programming curriculum for a political science research class. 
		 During my employment, I worked with 20 other TAs to effectively addressed student inquiries and assist in the preparation of study materials for study sessions and exam reviews. 
		 This role allowed me to contribute to the education of over 200 students and provided me with valuable teaching and collaborative skills.

			to develop Tableau dashboards that visualize athlete performance over time.
		        Working solo, I designed two dashboards for coaches and over 40 players to track individual and team performance.
			This project captured the attention of the Athletics department and demonstrated the quality and power of student work,

                        In close collaboration with a team of four members, I contributed to the development of a restaurant management web application. 
			Leveraging the Django web app framework, we successfully integrated a custom-built SQLite database. 
			I took on the responsibility of creating complex stored procedures and triggers to ensure efficient updating, deleting, adding of application data. 
			Despite being my first time working on a web app and using Django, I successfully created the data, schema, ERDs, triggers, and stored procedures from scratch.

			It was my first end-to-end data science project, involving scraping, cleaning, and analyzing 10GB of data from 12 appellate courts. 
			Utilizing advanced NLP techniques, such as sentiment analysis and LDA topic modeling, we derived metrics for complexity, polarity, and subjectivity. 
			Collaborating with a professor, we successfully integrated our findings and methodology into ongoing research. 
			Despite challenges with messy real-world data, we designed and implemented the entire ETL pipeline. 
			Through presentations and discussions, we effectively conveyed our work, covering all phases of the data science process.

			Through turn-based simulation, the program brings together meticulously crafted stats and tendencies for 20 animals, derived from extensive research into attack patterns, strength, environments, and other relevant variables to predict a winner. 
			The Animal Fight Simulator makes use of the tkinter library, enabling the creation of an interactive user interface. This project provides a fun and relatively scientific way to predict the outcome of animal duels.
